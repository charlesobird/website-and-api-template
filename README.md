# A Basic Website and API Template

Uses ExpressJS for the API with just HTML, CSS and JS for the Website

## Directory Layout

`api/` is where all the code is for the API. To locally test run the command: `npm run test`, it will then be available on `http://localhost:3000`
`website/` is where all the code, assets, etc for the website can be found, to test this, either open the `index.html` file directly or use Five Server, or another Live Server

For further information on how the API works, see the `README.md` file within the `api/` directory.
